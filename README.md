> Create an infographic.
> 1. Infographics are very brain-friendly. They create a powerful verbal/visual mix that helps encode information in students’ long-term memory.

> 2. Plus, they can be fun to create! They can end up being these visually stimulating products of student learning … the kind that students want to share with others!

> 3. I love pulling in icons from The Noun Project or Flat Icon to blend with short snippets of text — phrases or single sentences.

> 4. Pro tip: To keep students from spending inordinate amounts of time searching for the perfect icon, share a Google Drawings template for them to use where you’ve provided lots of icons. I’ve done this in these “icon boards” templates. Make something of your own — or copy one of mine and assign it to your students!

> 5. As mentioned earlier, end-of-semester final projects won’t include everything students have learned. Infographics force them to summarize, to be succinct, to curate and choose carefully.
